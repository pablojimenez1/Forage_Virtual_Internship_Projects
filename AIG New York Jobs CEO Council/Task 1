The CISA has recently published the following two advisories:

The first advisory (Log4j), outlines a serious vulnerability in one of the world’s most popular logging software.
The second advisory explores how ransomware has been increasing and is becoming professionalized - a concern for a large company like AIG.
Your task is to respond to the Apache Log4j zero-day vulnerability that was released to the public by advising affected teams of the vulnerability. 

First, conduct your research on the vulnerability using the “CISA Advisory" resources provided above as a starting point.
