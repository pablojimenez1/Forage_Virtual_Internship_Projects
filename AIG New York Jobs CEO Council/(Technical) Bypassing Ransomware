In this task, you will write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file.

Bruteforcing is the act of repeatedly trying different combinations to break the password encryption (based on either randomly generated passwords, or from a list of passwords to try). In the resource below, we've provided a small subset of passwords from Rockyou - a widely know password wordlist that contains thousands of common passwords in one wordlist.

Ransomware will often encrypt all files on a device, and sometimes give the decryption key after the ransom has been paid (but this is not always the case!). In this task, we would like you to break the encryption without paying the ransom.

A foundational Python 3+ template has also been provided for you in the resource below. One potential implementation is described in the code comments.
