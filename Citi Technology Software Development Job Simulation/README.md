# Citi Technology Software Development Job Simulation

## Overview:
This repository documents my participation in the **Citi Technology Software Development Job Simulation** on the Forage platform. During this simulation, I worked on hypothetical tasks aimed at improving Citi's **loan management system** and **stock market risk reporting**. I developed technical solutions, including building a real-time data visualization tool using Java, creating state diagrams, and researching machine learning systems for credit risk assessment.

**Simulation Highlights:**

1. **Improving Loan Management System**  
   - Created a **state diagram** using **UML (Unified Modeling Language)** to represent the loan management process. This visual aid helped to clarify the steps involved in loan processing and improve system design and flow.
   
2. **Machine Learning for Credit Risk Assessment**  
   - Researched potential **machine learning** algorithms for assessing **credit risk**. Based on the findings, I provided actionable recommendations for future steps to enhance Citi's risk assessment capabilities.

3. **Real-Time Stock Market Risk Visualization**  
   - Built a tool using **Java** to visualize **stock market risk** in real time. The tool provided insights into the risk factors affecting the stock market, aiding in quicker decision-making and better risk management.

4. **System Design & Back-End Development**  
   - Focused on **back-end development** and system design, particularly in creating efficient processes for risk assessment and improving loan management. I designed the system to be scalable and integrated with other internal tools.

5. **Written Communication & Documentation**  
   - Documented and presented technical solutions in clear and concise language, making complex processes and findings accessible for stakeholders without technical expertise.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- **UML & State Diagrams**: Gained experience in using **UML** to design system processes and flow, particularly for **loan management systems**.
- **Java Development**: Strengthened my **Java** programming skills by developing an internal tool to visualize stock market risk.
- **Machine Learning**: Researched and recommended **machine learning** solutions for **credit risk assessment** in financial applications.
- **Back-End Development & System Design**: Developed solutions for back-end development, with a focus on **risk assessment** and **data visualization**.
- **Data Visualization**: Created real-time data visualization tools for stock market risk using Java.
- **Risk Assessment**: Applied **risk assessment** techniques to financial systems, offering improvements and recommendations for better decision-making.
- **Written Communication**: Produced clear documentation and communication for stakeholders, making complex technical information accessible.

**Skills Developed:**
- **Java Programming**: Improved my ability to develop software solutions using **Java**, particularly for real-time data visualization.
- **System Design & Development**: Enhanced my skills in **system design**, particularly for **back-end development** and **loan management processes**.
- **Machine Learning**: Gained insights into how **machine learning** can be used for practical financial applications like **credit risk** assessment.
- **Risk Management**: Built a deeper understanding of financial **risk management** and the tools used for evaluating **stock market risk**.
- **Communication & Documentation**: Strengthened my ability to communicate technical processes effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Objective: 
This repository reflects the skills and knowledge gained during the **Citi Technology Software Development Job Simulation**. I am eager to apply these skills in a **Technology Software Development** team at **Citi**, especially in improving internal processes and utilizing emerging technologies like **machine learning** for better **risk management** and **system efficiency**.
