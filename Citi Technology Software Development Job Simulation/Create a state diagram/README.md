# Here is the background information on your task
You've just been hired as the newest intern in Citi's Technology Analyst Program. Over the course of your internship, you'll work within the Technology Software Development team, where you'll help to develop Citi's internal systems and products. Today, your team lead has approached you with a new task. Citi's loan management system needs some new features, but before you can dive into the code, you need to understand how the system works. Your team lead has suggested you create a state diagram of the loan management process using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to ensure you understand the loan workflow. Your state diagram will need to show the various stages of the loan management process, from the initial loan application to the completion of the loan payoff.

Before you get started with your state diagram, your manager has also provided you with a brief overview of the loan process. The loan management process typically starts with a loan application, which is then reviewed and either approved or rejected. If the loan application is approved, the loan is disbursed, and the borrower begins to make regular payments. Over the course of the loan, the loan's status may change depending on the borrower's ability to make payments on time.

As an intern, your task is to draw a state diagram that reflects the loan management process, capturing the key states and transitions to provide a concise representation of the system's behavior. While developing this diagram, you'll learn how to create and interpret state diagrams, and you'll develop a better understanding of how a loan management system works!
