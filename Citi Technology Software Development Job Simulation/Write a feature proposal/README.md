# Here is the background information on your task
Now that you’ve completed your state diagram of the loan management system, your team lead has another task for you! Credit risk prediction is a critical aspect of loan approval, but currently, this process is largely handled manually. Risk is typically assessed by manual review of financial statements and credit reports, which is both time-consuming and prone to human error. 

Because of this limitation, your team lead thinks that there is an opportunity to make this process more efficient. They would like to incorporate machine learning into the loan approval pipeline by adding a credit risk modeling step that assesses the risk of a given loan. They believe that this change will make the credit risk assessment process both faster and more efficient.

Before the development team can add this feature, however, the team lead would like you to dig into its plausibility. They would like you to learn about how machine learning systems are currently used to assess credit risk. Then, they would like you to write up a brief proposal for this feature. Your proposal should include information about how the system might work, as well as potential challenges and limitations.

Once you’ve completed this proposal, your team lead will review it and determine whether this should be pursued further.

# Here is your task
In this task, you’ll write a brief proposal for a credit risk modeling system for use in Citi’s loan management system. Here are your instructions:

1. Before you begin, review the resources provided below to learn about how existing credit risk modeling systems work.
2. Determine the data your model will need. What input variables will be used to predict credit risk?
3. Determine what the model will output. What will the output variables look like?
4. Explore possible model types and architectures that can be used for this system.
5. Consider the risks or challenges of creating a credit risk modeling system.
6. When you've collected all your ideas, write up a brief proposal for this potential feature! We've included a "Proposal Template" in the Resources section below to get you started, but you may write it in any way you think is appropriate.

Once you've completed your feature proposal, you can **submit it in the text submission box below using this template:**
