# Integrated Cyber Defense and Risk Management Simulation

This documentation showcases my work on PwC Switzerland's Cybersecurity Virtual Experience on Forage. It outlines my role in developing an integrated cyber defense and risk management strategy for Boldi AG, a family-owned Swiss chemical supplier. Through this simulation, I tackled real-world challenges such as information risk assessments, IT system security baselines, network segmentation, and vulnerability management. By leveraging strategic frameworks and technical expertise, I delivered actionable solutions that enhanced Boldi AG’s cybersecurity posture, showcasing my ability to bridge technical skills and business needs.

## Project Overview

The simulation placed me in the role of a cybersecurity consultant for PwC Switzerland, I was tasked with delivering an integrated cyber defense and risk management solution for Boldi AG, a family-owned Swiss supplier to the chemical industry. With 90 employees and a limited IT team, Boldi AG faced a wake-up call after a competitor was hit by a severe ransomware attack. Their last information risk assessment had been conducted nearly a decade ago, and they were seeking top consultancies to pitch cybersecurity services to bolster their defenses. I took on this challenge, applying both technical expertise and strategic thinking to steer Boldi AG toward a more resilient cybersecurity posture.


## Key Contributions and Tasks:

### Task 1: Integrated Information Defense

Our engagement began with a crucial call between our team and Boldi AG’s management, where I was able to explain the concept of integrated, layered defense. I emphasized that cybersecurity isn’t just about responding to intentional attacks but also about mitigating non-deliberate risks, like natural disasters. Boldi AG's IT infrastructure required a layered approach that safeguarded vital assets, core business processes, and public-facing boundaries. As we discussed these layers, I pointed out the biases that companies often fall victim to, such as ignoring blind spots, over-relying on existing systems and personnel, and failing to test their defenses rigorously.

Soon after the call, Boldi AG identified one such blind spot: their backup systems were stored offsite at an inadequately monitored facility, raising concerns about unauthorized access. Responding quickly, I and my team leader, Stefan, reminded them of the critical principles of information security, such as controlling access and regularly training staff. I further introduced them to the importance of a risk management framework, which provides organizations like Boldi AG the top-down guidance necessary to maintain a proactive cybersecurity posture.

The outcome of this interaction was a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation where I analyzed Boldi AG’s issue in terms of due care and due diligence. I helped differentiate these terms, showing where Boldi AG had fallen short of industry best practices. By integrating key defense principles such as Deter, Detect, Prevent, and Avoid, I laid out actionable strategies for Boldi AG to limit potential risks, thereby strengthening the final pitch presentation that led to our team winning the contract.


### Task 2: Risk Assessment

Winning the engagement was just the start. Our next objective was to conduct a thorough risk assessment for Boldi AG, a process requiring a deep understanding of the company’s risk culture. Through my onsite work, I learned how Boldi AG perceived risk and how their IT systems, both paper-based and cloud-based, lacked consistency and control over file access. This presented major concerns regarding confidentiality, integrity, and availability—the cornerstone concepts of information security.

To address these issues, I designed a slide deck that examined the security gaps using the CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) framework. I also explained the differences between quantitative and qualitative risk assessments, ultimately recommending a qualitative approach better suited to Boldi AG’s specific information security challenges. Through my work, I ensured that Boldi AG’s management understood not only the risks but also how to assess and prioritize them based on their impact.


### Task 3: IT System Security Baseline

Having assessed the risks, the next step was to help Boldi AG reduce them by implementing cybersecurity measures to decrease their overall threat surface. However, Boldi AG’s Head of IT Infrastructure was skeptical about the value of maintaining an up-to-date Information Systems Security Baseline. To address this, I researched the importance of vulnerability assessments, mitigation planning, and the role of consistent security baselines.

I created a visual graphic that explained these terms and how they interrelate. This graphic demonstrated that while vulnerability scans could detect issues at a point in time, maintaining an up-to-date security baseline was essential for long-term threat mitigation. Without this baseline, Boldi AG would lack the foundational controls needed to protect its infrastructure from evolving threats. My work convinced Boldi AG’s IT leadership of the importance of these measures, ensuring that their systems would be better protected moving forward.


### Task 4: Network Segmentation

Finally, I tackled the challenge of network segmentation, where Boldi AG’s IT team needed a deeper understanding of how this approach could enhance their cybersecurity. I provided Stefan with comprehensive notes explaining how segmentation isolates different parts of the network, limiting the spread of attacks and improving organizational security. I also addressed the configuration of firewalls in Boldi AG’s infrastructure, discussing both whitelisting and blacklisting approaches and recommending the best strategies to protect their segmented network zones.

The detailed documentation I provided helped Stefan prepare for a workshop that empowered Boldi AG’s IT team to implement and manage network segmentation effectively. By breaking down complex cybersecurity concepts into actionable insights, I played a key role in advancing Boldi AG’s defense against potential threats.


## Results Achieved:

My work on this project was praised by Stefan in a follow-up voicemail, recognizing my contribution to both winning the pitch and successfully delivering a comprehensive risk management solution. This project demonstrated not only my technical expertise in areas like network security, impact analysis, and system configuration but also my ability to think strategically, communicate complex ideas clearly, and solve real-world cybersecurity challenges.

By applying a holistic, layered approach to risk management and integrating key cybersecurity principles, I helped Boldi AG enhance its defense posture, making the company more resilient to potential threats in an increasingly dangerous digital landscape.
