**Domain:** A namespace which logically divides an organisationâ€™s network objects that share the same directory.

**Admin Zone:** Special purpose server zone, e.g. central logging, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

**Server Zone:** General purpose server zone, e.g. application servers, database servers

**Client Zone:** General purpose client zone, e.g. user laptops

Regarding network segmentation and trust architectures, the base configuration and maintenance of firewalls is of great importance. There are two approaches to configuring firewalls: whitelisting the good or blacklisting the bad.
 

Add to your notes how firewalls A, B, C, and D at Boldi AG need to be configured using the concepts of whitelisting and blacklisting and why.
