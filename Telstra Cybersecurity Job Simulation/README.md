# Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation 

## Overview 

I recently completed the Telstra Cybersecurity Job Simulation on Forage, and it was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The simulation provided a realistic glimpse into the day-to-day responsibilities of a Telstra Cybersecurity team member. Here's a breakdown of my experience and the tasks I undertook during the simulation.

## Task 1: Responding to a Malware Attack 

The first task involved responding to a malware attack, simulating the role of an information security analyst in the Security Operations Centre (SOC). Tackling this task required quick thinking and effective communication skills. I triaged the malware threat, identified the affected infrastructure, and promptly notified the relevant team via email. The emphasis on incident severity and precise communication added a layer of realism to the simulation.

## Task 2: Analysing the Attack

The second task delved into the analysis of the attack by examining firewall logs and identifying characteristics of the Spring4Shell vulnerability. This step highlighted the importance of collaboration between technical and non-technical teams. The provided proof of concept payload offered insights into the attacker's methods, and drafting an email to the networks team with my findings reinforced the significance of clear communication in cybersecurity.

## Task 3: (Technical) Mitigate the Malware Attack

Task 3 introduced a technical aspect, requiring collaboration with the networks team to implement a firewall rule using Python scripting. Developing the rule in `firewall_server.py` and testing it using `test_requests.py` provided hands-on experience in mitigating a malware attack. This task underscored the practical application of scripting languages in cybersecurity defense.

## Task 4: Incident Postmortem

The final task involved creating an incident postmortem. This retrospective analysis allowed me to document the timeline of the incident, understand the root cause, and outline the actions taken. Crafting an incident postmortem reinforced the importance of thorough documentation for future audits and team education.
