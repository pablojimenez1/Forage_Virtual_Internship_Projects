# Here is the background information on your task
You are an information security analyst in the Security Operations Centre. A common task and responsibility of information security analysts in the SOC is to respond to triage incoming threats and respond appropriately, by notifying the correct team depending on the severity of the threat. It’s important to be able to communicate the severity of the incident to the right person so that the organisation can come together in times of attack.

The firewall logs & list of infrastructure has been provided, which shows critical services that run the Spring Framework and need to be online / uninterrupted. A list of teams has also been provided, which depending on the severity of the threat, must be contacted.

It’s important to note that the service is down and functionality is impaired due to the malware attack.

# Here is your task
Your task is to triage the current malware threat and figure out which infrastructure is affected.

First, find out which key infrastructure is currently under attack. Note the priority of the affected infrastructure to the company - this will determine who is the respective team to notify.

After, draft an email to the respective team alerting them of the current attack so that they can begin an incident response. Make sure to include the timestamp of when the incident occurred. Make it concise and contextual.

The purpose of this email is to ensure the respective team is aware of the ongoing incident and to be prepared for mitigation advice.
