# JPMorgan Chase & Co. Cybersecurity Job Simulation

## Task 1 - Fraud in Financial Payment Services

This project involves the analysis of a recently acquired dataset of mobile money transactions from a financial services provider. The goal is to explore the dataset, understand the various types of transactions, and analyze fraud detection and occurrence within these transactions.


## Task 2 - Application Security Fundamentals

In this project, we aim to develop a secure Django web application enhanced with One-Time Password (OTP) authentication. This setup will ensure that users authenticate using not only their username and password but also a time-sensitive OTP, providing an additional layer of security.


## Task 3 - Spam or Ham: Email Classifier

Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated type of cybercrime that targets email systems within organizations. BEC attacks are designed to deceive employees into making unauthorized financial transactions or disclosing sensitive information. Given the critical nature of these attacks, it's essential to develop robust detection systems to identify and prevent BEC incidents.


## Task 4 - System to Tighten Access to Sensitive Information

The goal of this project is to design a system that simulates limiting the number of roles a user can have at any given point in time. This system aims to enforce the principle of least privilege, thereby minimizing security risks associated with excessive role assignments. By limiting roles, the system helps mitigate the impact of compromised accounts by reducing the attacker's access.
