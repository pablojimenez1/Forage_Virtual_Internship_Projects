# Here is your task
The Client is very concerned about the prospect of receiving an ICO Dawn Raid inspection, and would like you to call her to give her an overview of the key considerations and practical guidance as soon as possible. She usually has back to back meetings during the day, so has asked that you leave a message on her voicemail to listen to between meetings.  

For this task, please prepare a voice message to be left on the client's answering machine with key information about an ICO Dawn Raid.

We recommend taking approximately 1 hour to research the topic, and up to 30 minutes to prepare and record the voice recording. The voice recording should be between 4-6 minutes and include at least the following information:

## (1) Introduction

Explain who you are and why you are calling
A brief overview of what an ICO Dawn Raid is
What the ICO's powers are in an ICO Dawn Raid
 

## (2) Important things to know

What information can be withheld from the ICO (this is a key consideration for companies, as they are entitled to withhold certain types of information, however if they refuse to hand over documents that the ICO are entitled to, it increases their likelihood of penalty).
How the company should react when they are notified e.g., engaging local counsel, who they should inform, whether they should allow interviews, what devices they should be allowed access to.
This may be scenario specific advice or general common sense guidance relating to cooperation with investigatory bodies.
 

## (3) Any other information

Additional points that you think would be useful for the Client and the Company to know that would let them feel more prepared and or less worried about the possibility of being subject to a Dawn Raid. 
 

## (4) Close the call 

It may be useful to also prepare a written script first before recording. You can use the template included in the resources section below (we would suggest you keep your script to below 500 words).
