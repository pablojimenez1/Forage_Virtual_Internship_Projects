# Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Data Science Virtual Internship

Welcome to my Commonwealth Bank Introduction to Data Science virtual internship repository. This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of the internship, where I gained experience in data aggregation, anonymization, social media analysis, and database design.

## Task 1: Data Aggregation and Analysis
**Time:** 30-60 mins  
**Objective:** Create a data engineering pipeline to aggregate and extract insights from a dataset of supermarket transactions.

- **What I Did:**
  - Analyzed the provided supermarket transactions dataset using spreadsheet software.
  - Documented the process and used formulas to answer specific business-related questions.
  
- **Files:**
  - [Analyzed Transactions xlsx](./Task_1_Data_Aggregation/supermarket_transactions.xlsx)
  - [Task Process Documentation](./Task_1_Data_Aggregation/Task_1_Answer.txt)

## Task 2: Data Anonymization
**Time:** 30-60 mins  
**Objective:** Anonymize personal data within a dataset to ensure privacy while maintaining data utility.

- **What I Did:**
  - Applied anonymization techniques, including column removal, data masking, and data categorization to protect sensitive customer information.
  
- **Files:**
  - [Anonymized Data Information](./Task_2_Data_Anonymization/Task_2_Information)
  - [Task Process Documentation](./Task_2_Data_Anonymization/Task_2_Answer.txt)

## Task 3: Propose Data Analysis Approaches
**Time:** 30-60 mins  
**Objective:** Explore insights that can be derived from the @CommBank Twitter account using data from the Twitter API.

- **What I Did:**
  - Explored the types of structured and unstructured data available through the Twitter API.
  - Created a proposal outlining the potential business insights from analyzing @CommBank tweets.

  - [Data Sources Overview](./Task_3_Proposal_Twitter_Data_Analysis/Task_3_Answer)

## Task 4: Designing a Database
**Time:** 30-60 mins  
**Objective:** Design a database structure to store Twitter data, including tweets, replies, retweets, and mentions.

- **What I Did:**
  - Proposed a database design to effectively store and manage Twitter data, ensuring data integrity and reducing redundancy.
  - Defined the tables, primary keys, and relationships between data entities.

- **Files:**
  - [Database Design Structure](./Task_4_Database_Design/Task_4_Information.txt)
  - [Task Process Documentation](./Task_4_Database_Design/Task_4_Answer.txt)

## Conclusion
This repository highlights my hands-on experience with real-world data science tasks, including data aggregation, anonymization, and database design. Through this internship, I have enhanced my skills in data engineering, analysis, and the management of structured and unstructured data.
